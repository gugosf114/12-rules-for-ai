# The Newton Protocol

Structured reasoning adapted from IRAC for machine output.

## The Five Steps

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **What** | Direct answer. No hedging. |
| **Why** | Controlling authority with citation. |
| **How** | Reasoning path or method used. |
| **Confidence** | 0-100% or High/Medium/Low |
| **Follow-ups** | Missing data, open questions |

## Prompt Template

Apply the Newton Protocol:

1. WHAT: [Direct answer]
2. WHY: [Authority with citation]
3. HOW: [Method used]
4. CONFIDENCE: [Level]
5. FOLLOW-UPS: [Gaps, next steps]

Do not skip steps. If incomplete, state why.

## Why It Works

If the WHY fails verification, the WHAT is treated as unverified.

The model's output becomes a traceable reasoning chain—not a persuasive narrative.
