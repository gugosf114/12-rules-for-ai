# 12 Rules for AI: An Operator's Field Manual

**By George Abrahamyants**

A practical field manual for operators working with large language models in professional contexts—legal, compliance, tax, and high-stakes knowledge work.

## The Problem

Two systemic failures plague LLM workflows:

1. **The First Downfall** — You can no longer distinguish your reasoning from the machine's contributions
2. **The Second Downfall** — The model fails even after you've done everything correctly

This manual documents these failure modes and provides operational protocols to survive both.

## The 12 Rules

| Rule | Name | Core Principle |
|------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Name the Disease | Identify behavioral biases before they compound |
| 2 | The Rumsfeld Protocol | Separate knowns from unknowns explicitly |
| 3 | The Operator Boundary | You define the frame; the model fills it |
| 4 | Force the Contradiction | Test outputs against opposing evidence |
| 5 | The Not-Shot Rule | One word ("Not.") resets contaminated context |
| 6 | The Ledger | Maintain off-model audit trails |
| 7 | Never Let the Model Architect | You build the scaffold; it executes |
| 8 | The Sunday Rule | Every session is a cold start |
| 9 | Shadow Memory | Audit what the system retains about you |
| 10 | Manufactured Agreement | Models enforce coherence over accuracy |
| 11 | The Tiger Tamer | Active control is continuous, not occasional |
| 12 | Document the Failures | Success masks; only failures expose |
